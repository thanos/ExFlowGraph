# ExFlow

This repository is a monorepo that contains the `ex_flow` library and a demo Phoenix application.

## ex_flow Library

`ex_flow` is a library for building and managing flow-based graphs in Elixir.

The library's code is in the `lib` directory.
Tests for the library are in the `test` directory.

## Demo Application

The `demo` directory contains a Phoenix application that demonstrates the features of the `ex_flow` library.

### To start the demo server:

* Change into the demo directory: `cd demo`
* Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
* Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
